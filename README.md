A very prestigious chain of hotels is facing a problem of huge consumption of electricity bills for
its electronic equipments. The common equipments, like lights, ACs, etc are currently controlled
manually, by the hotel staff, using manual switches. Hotel Management wants to optimise the
usage of electricity consumption and also ensure that there is no inconvenience caused to the
guests and staff. So, it has installed Motion Sensors at appropriate places and have approached
you to program a Controller which takes inputs from these sensors and controls various
equipments.
